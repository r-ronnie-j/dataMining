Hint: As per IS standards. Heavy stones are used in the construction of abutments, dams,\\ndocks. Lighter ones are used in building construction.\\n29. Hint: Pugging or tempering is done by adding water to brick earth and kneading until a\\nhomogenous mass and required plasticity is attained\\n37. Hint: Unburnt bricks are the one dried in the sun, after moulding. They are kept for a long\\ntime until they dry. Sometimes due to a large number of bricks, limited time, improper\\nworkman skills, the bricks are not completely dried and hence are called Kucha bricks.\\n53. Hint: Onyx has a creamy, pearl like look. It is not commonly used for flooring but can be\\nemployed for skirting around bathtubs and mosaics.\\n85. Hint: Pozzolana is a material containing silica. PPC is formed by intergrinding ordinary\\nPortland cement, clinker, gypsum and pozzolanic material.\\n93. Hint: The grades of cement are specified by IS 1489-1991. Cements are usually graded based\\non their compressive strength.\\n95. Hint: Grade 43 OPC has higher strength than grade 33 and lower than grade 53. Grade 33 used\\nfor finishing works under normal condition. Grade 53 is used for high rise building.\\n97. Hint: Cement stored in the factory of more than 6 months has to be retested and rejected if it does not\\nmeet requirements. Time period of more than 3 months is for cement bags with vendors.\\n165. Hint: Nitro cotton is an element contained in cellulose paints, zinc white and white lead are\\ncomponents of enamel paints.\\n172. Hint: Shellac is a natural resin obtained from the secretion of the female lac bug. All other\\noptions are artificially obtained.\\n177. Hint: As per IS codes, the loading on brick specimen in a CTM should be uniform at rate of\\n14 N/mm2 per minute.\\n185. Hint: As per IS codes, number of bricks are tested in CTM and average is taken. It should be a\\nminimum of 3.5 N/mm2.\\n193. Hint: The value is in accordance with the IS code 12269 for 53 grade OPC. Table 3 gives\\nphysical requirements and fineness is one of them.\\n196. Hint: Three types are natural sand (river banks), crushed stone sand (hard stone) and crushed\\ngravel sand (gravel).\\n205. Hint: According to IS 565, the sieve sets are 80mm, 40mm, 20mm, 10mm, 4.75mm for coarse aggregates.\\n208. Hint: The 5 methods are throw-action, horizontal, tapping, wet and air circular jet.\\n213. Hint: IS 2720 gives the specifications. It requires using sample weighing 5 kg for coarse\\naggregates and 1 kg for fine aggregates.\\n214. Hint: Cast iron contains 2-4% of carbon, wrought iron contains less than 0.15% of carbon and\\nstainless steel contains maximum 0.08% carbon.\\n218. Hint: TMT bars are produced by sudden quenching of red hot steel bars by spraying water.\\nHence it is called Thermo Mechanically Treated bar.\\n226. Hint: PMB stands for Polymer Modified Bitumen. These are produced by adding polymers\\nlike styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), SBR, polyethylene, etc. The polymers help in\\nmodifying the properties of bitumen.\\n229. Hint: Bitumen is graded in terms of penetration and viscosity. According to penetration grading, the\\n80/100 grading indicates that the penetration of bitumen is between 8 to 10 mm. Viscosity grading\\nis represented by VG 10, which has penetration value in the range 8 to 10 mm.\\n234. Hint: Spot test is a type of chromatographic test which determines if the bitumen is cracked or\\nnot. It is used to check if bitumen has been damaged by overheating.\\n160 A Quick Reference Book for CIVIL ENGINEERING LICENSING EXAMINATION', '243. Hint: There are over 2300 species of termites but only about 4% of the termite spaces are\\nresponsible for the damage of the buildings. The termites live in a colony and they are\\nvery fast in eating wooden and other cellulosic materials as food.\\n247. Hint: Stepped foundation is adopted when the construction becomes uneconomical to provide\\nfoundations at the same level. In this, minimum depth of 800 mm should be provided at\\nall the points.\\n253. Hint: Generally the plinth level is provided at about 300 to 400 mm above finished ground\\nlevel. It is suggested that plinth level should be decided by considering the top level of\\nthe ground and hence considering the level.\\n258. Hint: The total amount of settlement should be generally limited between 40 mm and 100 mm.\\nThe term differential settlement indicates the relative settlement of the adjacent portion\\nof the structure.\\n262. Hint: Timber Grillage Foundation uses Timber planks and Timber beams in the place of Steel\\njoists. This Foundation is especially useful in waterlogged areas where the bearing\\npower of soil is very low.\\n286. Hint: As the name suggests, the Garden-wall bond is used for the construction of the boundary\\nwalls, compound walls, Garden walls, etc. The wall is one brick wall and its height does not\\nexceed 2 metres. The wall my may be constructed either in English bond or Flemish bond.\\n294. Hint: Glazed finish is used to give a very pleasing and shiny appearance to the surfaces.\\nHence, this type of surface finish is widely used for decorative works.\\n298. Hint: In horizontal reinforcement, wrought iron flat bars called hoop iron is extensively used.\\nThe number of strips of hoop iron used for one header brick is generally two.\\n310. Hint: Vibroflotation increases the density of soil which ultimately results in the increase of\\nbearing capacity of soil. This method is useful for granular or sandy soil and before the\\nprocessing of underpinning start, the building or any of its structure components is\\nshored carefully.\\n318. Hint: Hot bitumen is a flexible material and is placed on the bedding of concrete or mortar.\\nThis material should be applied with a minimum thickness of 3 mm.\\n327. Hint: Chamfering forms an angle of 45° and a V joint will be formed when two chamfered\\npieces are placed together. If the angle of chamfer is other than 45°, it is known as the\\nBevel. If the chamfer does not continue for the full length of timber, it is called as\\nStopped Chamfer.\\n342. Hint: The joists are usually placed at the centre to Centre distance of 300 mm to 450 mm. The\\njoists are supported on the wall plates at their ends. The space of about 50 mm is kept for\\nthe circulation of the air.\\n344. Hint: The joists may be either rest on wall or on Steel beam. The joists act as reinforcement\\nand are spaced at a centre to Centre distance of 600 mm to 900 mm.\\n351. Hint: The moorum is a form of disintegrated rock with the binding material. It is laid in layers\\nof 80 mm to 150 mm thickness over a prepaid subgrade and it is well consolidated and\\nwell water every time. Finally, layer of 25 mm thickness of powdered or fine moorum is\\nspread and water is sprinkled over it.\\n367. Hint: Metal lath is prepared from sheets of mild steel which are machine cut and drawn out or\\nexpanded. A diamond mesh appearance is thus formed throughout the whole area of the\\nsheet. The hybrid which is steel lath can also be used for this purpose\\n371. Hint: The Flaking is mainly due to Bond failure between successive coats of plaster. Uneven\\nsurfaces becomes prominent only due to poor workmanship of the work.\\nBasic Civil Engineering 161', '379. Hint: Hence, Gypsum plaster is used as an insulating material to protect wood or metal\\ncolumns and beams from high temperatures. It is light in weight. To decrease the weight,\\nthe fillers such as saw dust, wood shaving, etc. may be added to it.\\n383. Hint: In sand faced finish, the thickness of the first coat is 12 mm while the thickness of the\\nsecond coat is 8 mm. The sand in the mortar mix for the second coat should be perfectly\\nscreened in order to obtain a uniform size resulting in the surface having sand grains of\\nuniform density.\\n385. Hint: In rough cast finish, the mortar for the final coat has the ratio 1 : 3/2 : 3 (cement : sand :\\naggregate). Here, the size of the coarse aggregate varies from 3mm to 12 mm. A large\\ntrowel is used to dash the mortar against the prepared plastered surface.\\n411. Hint: The center of gravity is given by, y = (a y + a y ) / (a + a ) = ( 36 × 11.5 + 30 × 5) / (36\\n1 1 2 2 1 2\\n+ 30) = 8.545cm.\\n412. Hint: The center of gravity is given by, y = (a y + a y + a y ) / (a + a + a ) = (20 × 18 + 30\\n1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 3\\n× 9.5 + 40 × 1 / (20 + 30 + 40) = 1.611cm.\\n414. Hint: The centroid of the volume is the point where total volume is assumed to be\\nconcentrated. It is the geometric centre of a body. If the density is uniform throughout\\nthe body, then the center of mass and center of gravity correspond to the centroid of\\nvolume. The definition of the centroid of volume is written in terms of ratios of integrals\\nover the volume of the body.\\n417. Hint: The theorem of parallel axis states that if the moment of inertia of a plane area about an\\naxis in the plane of area through the C.G. of the plane area be represented by IG, then\\nthe moment of the inertia of the given plane area about a parallel axis AB in the plane of\\narea at a distance h from the C.G. is given by the formula IAB = Ah2 + IG.\\n418. Hint: The moment of inertia of a circle, I = πD4/64 = 491.07 cm4\\nThe area of circle = 78.57 cm,\\nRadius of gyration = (I/A.1/2 = 2.5 cm.\\n424. Hint: The moment of inertia of a rectangular section about an horizontal axis passing through\\nbase = bd3/3 = 5x10x10x10/3 = 1666.66 mm4.\\n425. Hint: The moment of inertia of a triangular section about the base = bh3/12 = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4/12 = 21.33\\nmm4.\\n426. Hint: The moment of inertia of a triangular section about an axis passing through C.G. and\\nparallel to the base = bh3/36 = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4/36 = 7.11 mm4.\\n427. Hint: The moment of inertia of a triangular section about the base is bh3/12. The moment of\\ninertia of a triangular section about an axis passing through C.G. is bh3/36. So the\\ndifference = bh3/12 – bh3/36 = bh3/18.\\n430. Hint: The moment of inertia about x-axis and about y-axis, on the axis they are zero. So the\\nproduct of inertia will be zero in the principal axis.\\n432. Hint: The product of inertia = Area × C.G = π × 10 × 10 / 4 × 5 × 5 = 1963mm2.\\n444. Hint: W.K.T, L.C = s/n, S = (1/4)˚ = 15(cid:31) and L.C = 20(cid:31)(cid:31) = 20/60 min. So, 20/60 = 15/n, n =\\n45.\\n449. Hint: Length of a line is computed by knowing the average length of pace. Pacing is a rough\\nsurveying. Chaining gives almost accurate readings. Taping gives accurate readings.\\n455. Hint: Magnetic Declination is the horizontal angle between true meridian and magnetic\\nmeridian. Declination = +5°38’, magnetic bearing = 48°24’, then here, true bearing is\\nsum of both i.e 48″24′ + 5°38′ = 54°02′.\\n457. Hint: Distance parallel to the chain = l sin∆/ s = 10 sin 6°/ 5 = 0.209 cm.\\n162 A Quick Reference Book for CIVIL ENGINEERING LICENSING EXAMINATION', '465. Hint: Geodic surveying is used because it is assumed that the distances between the points\\nobserved are not large so that either the effect of curvature and refraction may be\\nneglected or proper corrections may be applied linearly.\\n472. Hint: When observations are taken from P the apparent difference in elevation between P and\\nQ is 2.748 – 1.824 = 0.924. When observations are taken from Q the apparent difference\\nin elevation between P and Q is 1.606 – 0.928 = 0.678. Hence true difference in\\nelevation is (0.924 +0.678)/2 = 0.801 mts. Error in observation = 0.924 – 0.801= 0.123\\nm. Error due to curvature and refraction is 0.069 mts. Therefore error in collimation is\\n0.123 + 0.069 = 0.192 m. If ∆ is the inclination of line of the site then tan∆ = 0.192/1010\\n= 0.000190. Therefore ∆ =39″.\\n480. Hint: In the rise and fall method, first we must calculate the difference between B.S and F.S.\\nWe get 1.142 – 2.121 = -0.979 m, which is negative. It means we have to subtract it\\nfrom the given B.M for obtaining R.L i.e., R.L = 400 – 0.979 = 399.021 m.\\n481. Hint: 6d2\\nWe know that combined correction for curvature can be given as C= .\\n14R\\n6d2 6 × 2.942\\nOn substituting the value the of d in the above equation we get, C = = =\\n14R 14 × 6370\\n0.5814\\n487. Hint: The value of radius with respect to only radius can be given as, R = 5730/D. On\\nsubstitution, we get R = 5730 / 23.76 R = 241.16 m.\\n488. Hint: In degree of curvature, the value of radius can be designated by using 20m arc length. The\\nformula is given as R = 1146 / D. On substitution, we get R = 1146 / 24.65 = 46.49 m.\\n502. Hint: Difference in scale, age of data, format of the data, qualitative and quantitative errors act\\nas a source of inaccuracy. Inaccuracy develops due to lack of technique in the work\\nwhich is being done.\\n520. Hint: To get the quantities, the lengths found using the long wall-short wall method are\\nmultiplied with breadth and depth. In this method, the centre line lengths of the\\nindividual walls are calculated first to get the length of the short wall and the long wall.\\n531. Hint: The ratio 1:3:6 is for cement, sand and coarse aggregate. Therefore, the quantity of\\ncoarse aggregate required for RCC (1:3:6) for 20 cubic metres of work is [6/(1 + 3 + 6)]\\n× 1.52 × 20 m3 i.e. 18.24 m3.\\n534. Hint: The weight of one cement bag is 50 kg. Therefore, the number of cement bags required\\nfor 2500 kg of cement is 2500/50 i.e. 50 bags.\\n535. Hint: Approximately 1.52 m3 of dry concrete is required for 1 m3 of wet concrete. The\\nquantity of sand required for RCC (1:2:4) for 15 cubic metres of work is [2/(1 + 2 + 4)]\\n× 1.52 × 15 m3 i.e. 6.51 m3.\\n536. Hint: The quantity of cement required is [1/(1 + 2 + 4)] × 1.52 × 15 m3 i.e. 3.257 m3. SP\\nweight of concrete is 1440 kg/m3 and the weight of one cement bag is 50 kg. Therefore,\\nthe number of cement bags required for RCC (1:2:4) for 15 m3 of work is 3.257 ×\\n1440/50 = 93.8 bags.\\n***\\nBasic Civil Engineering 163']\n",
